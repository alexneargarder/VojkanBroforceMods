## Info

**Based on:** Jack Burton (Big Trouble in Little China, 1986)

**Primary attack:** TEC 9 semi automatic pistol.

**Special attack:** comes in two forms, two throwable knives dealing significant damage (but Jack is vulnerable during the throw animation) and a single magic potion that gives Jack temporary invulnerability and a sweat.

**Melee attack:** Considering Jack Burton is a uniquely useless hero character, his melee reflects this character trait so he - asks questions.Unless you move, in which case his dashing melee is a simple punch.

*"May the wings of liberty never lose a feather."*
