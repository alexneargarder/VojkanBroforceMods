## Info

**Based on:** Stallone's Lt.Marion 'Cobra' Cobretti (Cobra, 1986)

**Primary attack:** Jatimatic SMG with (just for looks) laser sight; automatic.

**Special attack:** Colt MK IV/Series 80 pistol. Single-action, semi-automatic. Holds six powerful bullets.
As long as there are bullets in the pistol magazine, Cobro can pull the pistol out of his jeans and back in, switching to primary SMG (if you keep holding fire button while switching from pistol to SMG it will start firing automatically after a second - but pistol has to be fired manually ofc).

**Melee attack:** Cobro takes his time to drink warm Coors Banquet and tosses the can that attracts the enemies. So it can be used as a tactical distraction...or just looking cool.

His dashing melee (when you hold the direction button and press melee) comes in two flavours. If you have your pistol out it will be a pistol whip. But if you have your SMG out it will be Cobro's powerful right/left hook to the face.

*"Terrorism is a disease. Meet the cure."*
